Project ideas you may find in this repo:
- Personal portfolio website (this site) — frontend with animations and AI chat widget.
- Data analysis & visualization notebooks.
- AI-powered demos and small web tools.

## Quick Setup (for this repo)

If you want to run the portfolio locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required for static content).
